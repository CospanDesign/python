;
; The format is described at:
; http://sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=Level_format
;   @ - The starting position of the player.
;   $ - The starting position for a pushable star.
;   . - A goal where a star needs to be pushed.
;   + - Player & goal
;   * - Star & goal
;  (space) - an empty open space.
;   # - A wall.
;
; Level maps are separated by a blank line (I like to use a ; at the start
; of the line since it is more visible.)
;
; I tried to use the same format as other people use for their Sokoban games,
; so that loading new levels is easy. Just place the levels in a text file
; and name it "starPusherLevels.txt" (after renaming this file, of course).
